# parking_lot_management

This is a academic project developed in C++.
Basic idea was to make the manual parking system automatic i.e computerized.
This is admin side product, gives full privileges to maintain record to administrator.

Little C graphic is used to give better UI.
All the data is maintained in binary file system.

Screenshots are provided.
Project is not executable on Cygwin but you can execute it on DOSBOX
